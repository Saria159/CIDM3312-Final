Hello Professor Dana,

This is my final project for the class CIDM3312. It has a sort, search, and pagination, as well as lists ingredients. I was unable to complete one promise that it would calculate
the total calories, I decided tho try and hard code the total calories. This is for full transparency.

Edit throws an error that I seemingly was unable to fix.




Thank you,
Sina Aria
